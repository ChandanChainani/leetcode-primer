# Detailed and Well formed solutions for **LeetCode** problems

## Getting Started

This **[website](https://theodesp.github.io/leetcode-primer/)** contains nearly complete solutions  to various - [**LeetCode**](https://leetcode.com/) solutions.
My motivation was to try to organize solutions to help people and myself study algorithms. By using [Markdown (.md)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files, this page is much more readable on portable devices.

## How I Generate the Website?

I use the static site generator [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) and the theme [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material) to build this website.

We use [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) for rendering math expressions, which is fast and beautiful.
