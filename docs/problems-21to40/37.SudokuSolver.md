# 37. Sudoku Solver

[TOC]

Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.

A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:

Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.
The '.' character indicates empty cells.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: board = [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: [["5","3","4","6","7","8","9","1","2"],["6","7","2","1","9","5","3","4","8"],["1","9","8","3","4","2","5","6","7"],["8","5","9","7","6","1","4","2","3"],["4","2","6","8","5","3","7","9","1"],["7","1","3","9","2","4","8","5","6"],["9","6","1","5","3","7","2","8","4"],["2","8","7","4","1","9","6","3","5"],["3","4","5","2","8","6","1","7","9"]]
```

**Constraints:**

* `board.length == 9`
* `board[i].length == 9`
* `board[i][j] is a digit 1-9 or '.'`
* It is guaranteed that the input board has only one solution.

## Problem Analysis

We need to create a data structure like a Set that will hold all the rows, columns and square numbers in the board.

We can then use backtracking to try to fill the missing values from each row, column or square and check if that creates a valid solution. If not we backtrack until we find a solution.

## Solutions

### Using backtracking

This function uses a backtracking algorithm to solve a Sudoku puzzle. It starts by creating three sets for each row, column, and 3x3 sub-box to keep track of the digits that have been used. Then it uses nested loops to fill the sets with the initial values from the board.

It uses a helper function `canPlace(i, j, num)` to check if a given number can be placed in a given cell, by checking if the number has already been used in the same row, column, or sub-box, and it uses the helper function `solve()` to start the backtracking process, it uses nested loops to iterate over the board and for each empty cell it tries all the possible numbers from 1 to 9, if the number can be placed in the cell.

he time complexity of this function is O(n^n) where n is the size of the board, 9 in this case.

The reason for this is that the function uses a backtracking algorithm to try all possible combinations of numbers in the empty cells of the board. This means that the algorithm will explore all possible solutions and for each empty cell it will try all possible numbers until it finds the correct one. The worst case scenario is when the board is completely empty, in that case the algorithm will have to try all possible combinations of numbers for each cell, resulting in a total of 9^81 or approximately 4.29*10^21 operations.

The space complexity of this function is $O(n)$ where n is the size of the board, 9 in this case.

This is because the function uses three sets to keep track of the digits that have been used in each row, column, and 3x3 sub-box. Each set stores at most 9 elements, so the total space required is 3*9 = 27 elements.
