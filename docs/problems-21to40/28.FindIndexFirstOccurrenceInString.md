# 28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String

[TOC]

Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
```

**Constraints:**

```
* `1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 10^4`
* `haystack` and `needle` consist of only lowercase English characters.
```

## Problem Analysis

The most straightforward solution is to use the `indexOf` method however this would be only a starting point of this problem.

A more typical way is to iterate over the heystack and try to match each character from the needle.

More advanced solutions are the KMP and Bayer-Moore algorithms that improve the shifting of the mismatched indices in case of a partial match.

## Solutions `

### BruteForce

The function first checks for the edge case where the needle is an empty string. In this case, it returns 0, since the first occurrence of an empty string in any string is at the start of the string.

The function then iterates through the haystack, one character at a time. For each character, it checks if it matches the first character of the needle. If it does, it enters a loop to compare the rest of the haystack starting at this position with the needle.

Inside the loop, the function compares the characters of the haystack and the needle, starting at the current position. It increments a counter j for each character that matches. If all the characters match, j will be equal to the length of the needle when the loop exits, indicating that the needle has been found.

If the needle is found, the function returns the starting index of the needle in the haystack. If the needle is not found, the function returns -1.

### Using Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm

Here are more sophisticated algorithms for finding the index of a string (the "needle") within another string (the "haystack"). One such algorithm is the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n + m) in the worst case.

The KMP algorithm works by creating a "prefix table" for the needle that indicates the maximum length of a proper prefix that is also a suffix of the needle. The algorithm then uses this prefix table to efficiently skip over portions of the haystack that are known to not match the needle.

### Using Boyer-Moore algorithm

The KMP algorithm does not return the correct result for the input haystack="leetcode" and needle="leeto". This is because the KMP algorithm only returns the index of the first occurrence of the needle in the haystack if the needle is a subsequence of the haystack.

For example, if the needle is "leet" and the haystack is "leetcode", the KMP algorithm will return 0 because "leet" is a subsequence of "leetcode". However, if the needle is "leeto" and the haystack is "leetcode", the KMP algorithm will not return a correct result because "leeto" is not a subsequence of "leetcode".

If you want to find the index of the first occurrence of a string that is not necessarily a subsequence of the haystack, you can use a different algorithm such as the Boyer-Moore algorithm.

This algorithm has a time complexity of $O(n + m)$ in the worst case, where n is the length of the haystack and m is the length of the needle.
