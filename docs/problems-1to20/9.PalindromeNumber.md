# 8. String to Integer (atoi)

[TOC]

Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
palindrome, and false otherwise.

**Note:**

* Only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.
* Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.
 
**Example 1:**
```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Constraints:**

```
-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1
```
